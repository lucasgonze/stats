{"name":"Stats","tagline":"Quick metrics for any old data. A console app.","body":"_stats_ is a Unix console utility which gives you a quick analysis of a set of numbers.  It is not only as simple as possible, it is even simpler: it reads data from standard input -- only -- and there are no\r\noptions or command line arguments.\r\n\r\n## Input\r\n\r\nA list of numbers separated by carriage returns, passed to the program by stdin.\r\n\r\nLines beginning with '#' are considered comments and are skipped.\r\n\r\n## Output\r\n* maximum (the largest item)\r\n* mean\r\n* median\r\n* minimum (the smallest item)\r\n* standard deviation\r\n* item count\r\n* sum (of all items)\r\n* a [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n   If there is a file named \"numbers.dat\", for example, and each line of the file is a number, you would invoke stats as follows:\r\n\r\n      cat numbers.dat | stats\r\n\r\n   If the file \"numbers.dat\" contains the following items:\r\n\r\n      1\r\n      2\r\n      2\r\n      3\r\n\r\n   Usage would look like this:\r\n\r\n````\r\n      bash-2.05b$ cat numbers.dat | stats\r\n             maximum: 3\r\n              median: 2\r\n             minimum: 1\r\n\r\n             average: 2\r\n  standard deviation: 0.816496580927726\r\n                 sum: 8\r\n          item count: 4\r\n\r\n           histogram:\r\n                      |  .\r\n                      | . .\r\n                      |_____\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Graph\r\n\r\nExplanation of the graph:\r\n\r\n* X axis represents a unique value\r\n* Y axis represents how many times the element occurred\r\n\r\nIn other words, it's a histogram.\r\n\r\nFor this particular set of inputs the graph shows that element counts rise from 0 to 2, then fall.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* Download the latest version.\r\n* Make it executable by doing \"chmod 755 stats\".\r\n* Copy it to a directory in your path, e.g. /usr/local/bin.\r\n* If perl is not installed in /usr/bin/perl on your system, you will need to change the first line of the the script from\r\n         #!/usr/bin/perl\r\n     to\r\n         #!/usr/local/bin/perl\r\n   or wherever your perl is installed.\r\n\r\n# Author\r\n   <a href=\"mailto:lucas@gonze.com\">lucas@gonze.com</a>\r\n   ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
